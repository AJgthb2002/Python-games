## Sudoku solver tool using python

[Sudoku] is a puzzle in which players insert the numbers 1 to 9 into a grid consisting of nine squares further subdivided into nine smaller squares in such a way that every number appears just once in each horizontal line, vertical line, and square.

The puzzle consists of some of the cells (usually less than half of them) already filled in, like this:
