Mancala (also known as 'Kalaha') is a 2- player board game with ancient heritage from Eritrea and Ethiopia, dating back as far as the 6th and 7th century, and is still enjoyed through to this day.

Initially, the board is set up with 4 stones in each of the 6 pits belonging to a player. Pits numbered from 0 to 5 and store on the left side belong to player 1. Pits from 7 to 12 and the store on the right side belong to player 2. The stores belonging to both players are initially empty.
During a turn, a player grabs all of the stones in a hole on their side and drops them, one by one, in succeeding holes in a counter-clockwise direction. Players place stones in their own store but they MUST skip over their opponent's store.This continues until the player has no more stones in his hand. It is then their opponents turn.

When all the pits of any player are empty, the game is over.
The player having maximum stones in their store wins.

This is a console based implementation of Mancala using python.
